This is my journal of the design and building process of **FootPedalDJ**.

## 10/5/2025 - Created Github and a Plan  

# FootPedalDJ

After some chat with ChatGPT I have decided what my frist Blueprint nad first overall hardware project will be. 

Think '_Elgato Stream Deck Pedal_' but homemade.

## What?

A foot pedal with two programable buttons. There are two modes built into the pedal; MIDI and Keyboard, this means when in MIDI mod (green LED's) each button will send a MIDI output but when in Keyboard mode (red) each button will send a key or key combination.

## Why?

This will be a fun first project with hands on experiance with PCB's, microcontrolers (for one learning what the things actually are). I've wanted to up my DJ'ing and why not have a pedal to easlly control MIDI but also be able to pause a youtube video with a press of my toe.

## Tier

Tier 4 – under $50, beginner project with PCB + 3D print.

## Repo

## 10/15/2025 - Made BOM & researched parts + costs  

OK, some change has come about. I have decided to follow [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3WevrsmO9o) tutorial but slighley edit the Audino code and possibley 3d print the case and add LED's and the ablity to switch between MIDI mode and keyboard. I made a `BOM.cvs` but am shocked as the prices to import stuff to the uk are shocking meaning I may have to apply for Tier 3 at the risk of not being apporved to afford all this.
